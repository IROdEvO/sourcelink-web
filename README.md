 Sourcelink is a  Real Time Application based on a series of tutorials developed 
 to help learn and teach the concepts involved in developing Real-Time applications using
 Google Firebase.
 
 This is the Web Application aspect which has been developed using Vue.JS.
 
 
 
 The following are the links to the specific tutorials each explaining features as we build them

## Project setup
Before running NPM Install ensure you create a .env file and provide the MDB Vue PRo ID

There are two additional `preisntall` and `postinstall` tasks to handle inserting and removing 
of the ID during install.

example of .env file should look like

```dotenv
MDB_VUE_PRO_ID='i5_gWisAtoP1We4KNOWw'  #this is ID just a sample and will not work
```


```
npm install
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
